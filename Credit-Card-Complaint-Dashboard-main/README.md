## Introduction

The Credit Card Complaint Dashboard is a Tableau project that provides a visual and interactive representation of credit card complaints. This dashboard allows users to explore and analyze credit card complaints data from an Excel sheet, enabling them to gain insights into customer complaints, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and product offerings.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard using Tableau to showcase credit card complaint data sourced from an Excel sheet. The dashboard will include various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and pie charts to present relevant information effectively. Users will be able to interact with the dashboard to filter, drill down, and explore specific aspects of the data.

### Key features of the Credit Card Complaint Dashboard:

1. Overview of overall credit card complaint trends.
   
2. Breakdown of complaints by categories (e.g., billing errors, fraud, customer service).
   
3. Geographic distribution of complaints using interactive maps.

4. Time-based analysis to identify seasonal patterns.

5. Top reasons for complaints and their frequency.
